Phonegap + Sencha demo
=====


This is a sample phonegap 1.6 project with slides for our presentation given at [2nd Phonegap Paris Meetup][1] the 12th April 2012. Proudly brought to you by the [revolunet team][2].

We provide a sample [Sencha Touch 2][4] app that loads contacts right from the phone and display them in a ListView and in a Carousel.

There is both an Android and a iOS sample Project.

This is a good start to setup a new phonegap+sencha MVC project.


Features inside :
---
 - sample Phonegap projects for android/ios
 - sample Sencha Touch 2 MVC application
 - phonegap loads the contacts from the phone then fills a Sencha data store

Basic Android dev environnement setup
---
 *I don't use eclipse, just ant (see [android cmdline setup][2])*

 1- Clone a sample phonegap project

 2- Edit `assets/www` folder and `AndroidManifest.xml` if needed

 3- run `ant debug install` to launch on AVD or physical device

 4- Enjoy :)
